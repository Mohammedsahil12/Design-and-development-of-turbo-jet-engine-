# Design-and-development-of-turbo-jet-engine-
in this project we will learn how to make a small jet engine and design the parts of jet engine using software and constructing the parts using CNC machines as well as assembly of the engine and making it work and testing which fuel will be more efficient in terms of performance as well providing high amount of thrust.
